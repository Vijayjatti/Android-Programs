Project:
MNotes       *PLEASE INSTALL "GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES" BEFORE RUNNING THE APP THROUGH SDK MANAGER*      

WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

1. To-Do List: We spent about 1 hour on polishing the UI. We have changed buttons to ImageButtons (Add and Save) 

2. Photo Notes: We did research about 1-2 hours on google map services and improved the accuracy of maps in finding the current location in the Picture Notes Activity.
   We have removed the buttons from our initial version and added the onClick images
   With this our Picture Notes activity is completed as per the initial plan.

3. WhiteBoard Activity: We planned to incorporate this in picture notes. we are unable to meet this requirement because of time constraint.
   But the working code which we worked is displayed in a new activity. (Just have to convert into Bit map and store it in external storage).
   

4. Reminder Activity : We did research on Adapters,Notification and Alarm Services,Broadcast Receiver, textChangedListeners, Date and TimePickers, 
   System-Reboot mechanism, ringtone and Vibration services for about 1 week and implemented the same in our Reminder Activity.   
   we have implemented "Edit or Remove" options for the list for our alarm activity.
   Added exceptions for Time and date picker so as to prevent the user to select the past time.
   Added Notifications with image icon on the action bar.
   
5. We spent 1-2 hours talking about how the app should look, feel, and work.
	Most this design has been implemented.
	We did research on images to the buttons
	
THIS VERSION OF THE APP INCLUDES:
1. A Complete todo list
2. Enhanced photo notes with google play services.   
3. A Complete Reminder activity 
4. White Board Activity


Problems we faced:
1. Time constraint: we had less than 2 days after our final exams.
2. Map Accuracy
3. Synchronizing check marks with strikethrough, in which we dropped strikethrough.
4. Took more time in handling the coloring options in canvas (White Board) 
5. Took most of time in understanding Services and System Reboot mechanism and how to implement the same.
